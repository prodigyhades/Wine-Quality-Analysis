# Wine Quality Analysis

Welcome to the Wine Quality Analysis project! 🍷 This project delves into the fascinating world of wine quality, acknowledging its subjectivity while aiming to predict and analyze it using various machine learning techniques and models.

## 📂 Project Contents

### 1. [Quality_Pred.ipynb](Wine_Quality_Analysis/Quality_Pred.ipynb)

The primary notebook that provides an in-depth analysis of wine quality prediction using different machine learning models. This file explores the dataset and walks through the various code segments employed for predicting the quality of wine.

### 2. [Xgboost.ipynb](Wine_Quality_Analysis/Xgboost.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on a specific model, XGBoost, for wine quality prediction. Notably, it allows user interaction by taking input to classify a wine sample as either good or bad. This interactive approach adds a practical dimension to the analysis.

### 3. [wineData.xlsx](Wine_Quality_Analysis/wineData.xlsx)

The dataset used for training and testing the wine quality prediction models. This Excel file contains the necessary information for a comprehensive exploration of the dataset.

#### Happy Predicting! 📊✨
